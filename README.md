# Senior Project - Software Security Learning Platform

Welcome to the Software Security Learning Platform, built by Fahd Sakas and Parker Esco under advisor Cheryl Resch for their Spring 2022 Senior Project.

The goal of this application is to introduce students to the topics of input validation and attacks such as cross site scripting and buffer overflow.

To run locally, "npm run dev" will concurrently run the server and client.
